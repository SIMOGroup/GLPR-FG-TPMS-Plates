# GLPR-FG-TPMS-Plates
This repository provides the basic source code of the investigation on the graphene platelets reinforced funtionally graded triply periodic minimal surface (GPLR-FG-TPMS) plates with the following features:
- Three novel functional grading frameworks for porous plates (mass density, elastic modulus, and shear modulus controlling frameworks);
- Three porosity distributions (symmetric, asymmetric, and uniform) in combination with three GPL volume fraction distributions (symmetric, asymmetric, and uniform);
- Five porous architectures (P, G, IWP, closed-cell, and open-cell cellular solids)
- Five-variable five-order shear deformation plate theory, isogeometric analysis (IGA); 
- Two analyses of square plate (static and free vibration);
- Efficiency comparison of five porous cores.
